# Array Data Structure (JAVA)


What is an array?

It is a collection of items of same type. Stored in contiguous memory locations

Why are they stored in continous memory locations ? 

It is easier to calculate the position of the elements in the array by offseting the base value.

*The location of the next index on the data type that is used*

- The arrays are dynamically allocated in memory
- The size of an array has to be specified by int or short
- The superclass of an array type is Object
- Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and Serializable


An array can contain primitives and non-primitives 

- Examples of primitives are (byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean)
- Examples of non-primitives are (String, Object)

An array stores primitive data type values in the contigous memory locations.
An array stores non-primitive data type values dynamocally allocated on a Heap.
