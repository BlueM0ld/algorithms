Decorator Design Pattern

The decorator pattern is a structural pattern

It is a wrapper object! You can apply this wrapper to an object/class to alter its behaviour without changing the orginal methods!


## Implementation


- Create an interface
- Create a set of classes (A) that implements the interface
- Create an abstract decorator class implementing the interface
- Create a decorator class extending the abstarct class
- You can use the decorator class to decorate the all classes (A)
